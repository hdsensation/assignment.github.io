            <p style="font-size: large;">A drink (or beverage) is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition
                to their basic function of
                satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain
                drinking water, milk, juice and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages include coffee, tea, and hot
                chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a long history.

                A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no alcohol. This category includes low-alcohol
                beer, non-alcoholic wine, and apple cider if they contain a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by
                volume (ABV). The exact definition of what is "non-alcoholic" and what is not depends on local laws: in
                the United Kingdom, "alcohol-free beer" is under 0.05% ABV, "de-alcoholised beer" is under 0.5%, while
                "low-alcohol beer" can contain no more than 1.2% ABV.[25] The term "soft drink" specifies the absence of
                alcohol in contrast to "hard drink" and "drink". The term "drink" is theoretically neutral, but often is
                used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop, sparkling water, iced tea,
                lemonade, root beer, fruit punch, milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, and tap water and energy
                drinks are all soft drinks.

            <p style="font-size: large;">Soft drink, any of a class of nonalcoholic beverages, usually but not
                necessarily carbonated, normally
                containing a natural or artificial sweetening agent, edible acids, natural or artificial flavours, and
                sometimes juice. Natural flavours are derived from fruits, nuts, berries, roots, herbs, and other plant
                sources. Coffee, tea, milk, cocoa, and undiluted fruit and vegetable juices are not considered soft
                drinks.

                There are many specialty soft drinks. Mineral waters are very popular in Europe and Latin America. Kava,
                made from roots of a bushy shrub, Piper methysticum, is consumed by the people of Fiji and other Pacific
                islands. In Cuba people enjoy a carbonated cane juice; its flavour comes from unrefined syrup. In
                tropical areas, where diets frequently lack sufficient protein, soft drinks containing soybean flour
                have been marketed. In Egypt carob (locust bean) extract is used. In Brazil a soft drink is made using
                mat√© as a base. The whey obtained from making buffalo cheese is carbonated and consumed as a soft drink
                in North Africa. Some eastern Europeans enjoy a drink prepared from fermented stale bread. Honey and
                orange juice go into a popular drink of Israel.

            </div>

            <p style="font-size: large;">A snack is a small portion of food generally eaten between meals.[1] Snacks
                come in a variety of forms
                including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients
                at home.
                Traditionally, snacks are prepared from ingredients commonly available at home without a great deal of
                preparation. Often cold cuts, fruits, leftovers, nuts, sandwiches, and sweets are used as snacks. With
                the spread of convenience stores, packaged snack foods became a significant business.
                Snack foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one
                form of convenience food, are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than
                prepared foods. They often contain substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing
                ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts, and specially-designed flavors (such as flavored potato chips).
                Beverages, such as coffee, are not generally considered snacks although they may be consumed along with
                or in lieu of snack foods.[2]
                A snack eaten shortly before going to bed or during the night may be called a "bedtime snack", "late
                night snack", or "midnight snack"</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Pretzels were introduced to North America by the Dutch, via New Amsterdam in
                the 17th century. In the
                1860s, the snack was still associated with immigrants, unhygienic street vendors, and saloons. Due to
                loss of business during the Prohibition era (1920-1933), pretzels underwent rebranding to make them more
                appealing to the public. As packaging revolutionized snack foods, allowing sellers to reduce
                contamination risk, while making it easy to advertise brands with a logo, pretzels boomed in popularity,
                bringing many other types of snack foods with it. By the 1950s, snacking had become an all-American
                pastime, becoming an internationally recognized emblem of middle American life</p>

                that the young man only cared about his intelligence.</p>
